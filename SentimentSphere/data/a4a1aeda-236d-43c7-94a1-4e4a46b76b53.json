  "summary": "Not paying off your credit card bill can lead to several negative consequences. It typically results in accumulating interest, which increases the total amount owed. Late payments can diminish your credit score, making it more difficult to obtain loans or favorable interest rates in the future. Over time, continuous non-payment might lead to increased fees, potential legal action, and a significant financial burden. Responsible credit card management involves making at least the minimum payments on time to avoid these adverse outcomes.",
