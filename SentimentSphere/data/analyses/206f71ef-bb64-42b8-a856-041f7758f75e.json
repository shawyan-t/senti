This album achieved significant commercial success, securing Carti his second No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 and making a notable splash on the Hot 100 with all 30 songs debuting on this chart. The album's success underscores both Carti's and Swamp Izzo's influential positions in the contemporary hip-hop scene.\n\nIn recent discussions, Swamp Izzo has revealed that Playboi Carti's next album, titled *BABY BOI*, is completed, though it has yet to receive an official release date.
