    "rationale": "The term 'Swamp Izzo' lacks a widely recognized cultural or domain-specific context, making it challenging to assign a definitive sentiment. Without additional context, such as whether this refers to a person, place, event, or cultural reference, the sentiment remains ambiguous. If 'Swamp Izzo' is a nickname or title, it could carry both positive and negative connotations depending on the context in which it is used. For example, 'Swamp' might imply something murky or negative, while 'Izzo' could be a reference to a respected individual, potentially balancing the sentiment. The lack of real-time data or specific cultural references limits the confidence in this assessment.",
