    "rationale": "The term 'SWAMP IZZO' is ambiguous without additional context. It could refer to a nickname, a cultural reference, or a specific event or person. Without further information, it is challenging to determine the sentiment accurately. The term 'swamp' can have negative connotations, particularly in political discourse where it might imply corruption or stagnation. However, 'Izzo' could be a reference to a person, such as Tom Izzo, a well-known basketball coach, which might carry positive connotations in a sports context. The lack of specific context makes it difficult to assign a clear sentiment.",
